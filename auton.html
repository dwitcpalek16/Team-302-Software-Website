<h1>Autonomous Routines</h1>
</div>

<div class="body">
<ul>
<li><p>Using text files to command the robot during autonomous period allows
us to quickly and easily change what it does and fine tune the distance the 
robot travels</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Changing a text file doesn't require us to recompile the robot code in
order to run the robot. This means that we can change one number and completely
change what the robot does instead of going into the code and changing the
order of actions</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>In fact, it is quite simple to write an autonomous routine. Go to 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OfBRSGNgQNdEvVWN_jkpCJ4g71-odb4KVF_UqCZFCe0/edit?usp=drive_web">
this link</a> to learn more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example auton file that moves the robot forward 6 feet:</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<img src="auton file example.png" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<ul>
<li><p>The first number tells which subsystem to control (1 is the drive-train)</p></li>
<li><p>The second number tells which action to perform (1 is drive forward for the drive system)</p></li>
<li><p>The third number tells the drive system how far to travel (in this case it will go 6 feet forward)</p></li>
<li><p>The last number tells how fast the robot will travel (it is a max speed of up to 21)</p></li>
<li><p>Generally the format is just <i>subsystem, inputs</i></p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the drive system has a speed controller which creates the second half of a trapezoidal motion profile.
This ensures that the robot stops right at its target distance.</p></li>
